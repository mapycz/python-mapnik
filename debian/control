Description: Python 2 interface to the mapnik library
 Mapnik is an OpenSource C++ toolkit for developing GIS
 (Geographic Information Systems) applications. At the core is a C++
 shared library providing algorithms/patterns for spatial data access and
 visualization.
 .
 Essentially a collection of geographic objects (map, layer, datasource,
 feature, geometry), the library doesn't rely on "windowing systems" and
 is intended to work in multi-threaded environments
 .
 This package contains the bindings for Python 2.
